# SQL-Projects
Objective :
In this project I have examine the dataset with SQL and help the store understand its business growth.
1) What is the total amount each customer spent on Zomato?
2) How many days did each customer visit Zomato?
3) What was the first product purchased by each customer?
4) What is the most purchased item on the menu, and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5) Which item was most popular for each customer?
6) Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7) Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8) What is the total number of orders and amount spent by each member before they became a member?
9) If buying each product generates points, such as:
5 Rs = 2 Zomato points for product 1,
10 Rs = 5 Zomato points for product 2,
5 Rs = 1 Zomato point for product 3,
calculate the points collected by each customer and determine for which product the most points have been given so far.
10) In the first one year after a customer joins the Gold program (including their joining date), customers earn 5 Zomato points for every 10 Rs spent. What was their points earning in their first year after membership?
11) Rank all the transactions of the customers.

# üçΩÔ∏è Zomato Data Exploration Project

Welcome to my Zomato Data Exploration project! This repository showcases my SQL expertise through a structured analysis of user data, highlighting insights into **Zomato Gold** user behavior and transaction trends. 

## üöÄ Project Highlights

- **Database Design & Management**: 
  - Created a comprehensive database named `zomato`, including tables like `goldusers_signup`, `users`, and `sales` to store and manage critical user and transaction data.
  - Ensured robust database design with checks for smooth table creation, updates, and data consistency.

- **In-Depth User Behavior Analysis**:
  - Conducted a thorough exploration of user sign-ups, membership durations, and purchase history.
  - Leveraged SQL to identify engagement patterns over time, focusing on Zomato Gold users.

## üí° Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Advanced SQL for Data Manipulation**:
  - Used powerful SQL commands (`CREATE`, `INSERT`, `DROP`, `SELECT`) to manage, clean, and query the data.
  - Leveraged date-based SQL operations for effective time-series analysis, uncovering trends and patterns in user behavior.

- **Data Exploration & Insight Generation**:
  - Developed queries to understand user signup trends, peak transaction periods, and loyalty patterns.
  - Created actionable insights for potential data-driven strategies that businesses could apply for customer retention and engagement.

## üåü Why This Project Stands Out

This project is a hands-on demonstration of my ability to structure, analyze, and derive insights from real-world datasets using SQL. The detailed approach to data management and exploration reflects my skills in:
- Building well-structured, reliable databases.
- Analyzing complex datasets to drive strategic insights.
- Using SQL efficiently to transform raw data into meaningful business insights.
