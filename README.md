Objective :

1) What is the total amount each customer spent on Zomato?
2) How many days did each customer visit Zomato?
3) What was the first product purchased by each customer?
4) What is the most purchased item on the menu, and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5) Which item was most popular for each customer?
6) Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7) Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8) What is the total number of orders and amount spent by each member before they became a member?
9) If buying each product generates points, such as:
5 Rs = 2 Zomato points for product 1,
10 Rs = 5 Zomato points for product 2,
5 Rs = 1 Zomato point for product 3,
calculate the points collected by each customer and determine for which product the most points have been given so far.
10) In the first one year after a customer joins the Gold program (including their joining date), customers earn 5 Zomato points for every 10 Rs spent. What was their points earning in their first year after membership?
11) Rank all the transactions of the customers.
