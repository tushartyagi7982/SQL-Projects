# SQL-Projects
Objective :
In this project I have examine the dataset with SQL and help the store understand its business growth.
1) What is the total amount each customer spent on Zomato?
2) How many days did each customer visit Zomato?
3) What was the first product purchased by each customer?
4) What is the most purchased item on the menu, and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5) Which item was most popular for each customer?
6) Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7) Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8) What is the total number of orders and amount spent by each member before they became a member?
9) If buying each product generates points, such as:
5 Rs = 2 Zomato points for product 1,
10 Rs = 5 Zomato points for product 2,
5 Rs = 1 Zomato point for product 3,
calculate the points collected by each customer and determine for which product the most points have been given so far.
10) In the first one year after a customer joins the Gold program (including their joining date), customers earn 5 Zomato points for every 10 Rs spent. What was their points earning in their first year after membership?
11) Rank all the transactions of the customers.


# Zomato Data Exploration

This project features a structured SQL-based analysis of user activity for Zomato, focusing on database management, table creation, and detailed exploration of user behavior, particularly for Zomato Gold users. By handling and analyzing structured data, this project showcases both data modeling and querying capabilities.

## Project Highlights

- **Database Creation and Table Management**: 
  - Established a database named `zomato` and developed essential tables like `goldusers_signup`, `users`, and `sales` to store and manage user and transaction data.
  - Included safety checks to ensure smooth table creation, deletion, and updates.

- **User and Transaction Analysis**:
  - Explored user behavior by examining sign-up dates, membership details, and purchase records.
  - Used SQL operations to derive meaningful insights from transactional data, focusing on user engagement over time.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **SQL Data Manipulation**:
  - Proficient use of `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `DROP`, and `SELECT` commands to manage and query data.
  - Effective handling of date-based data for time-series analysis.

- **Data Exploration and Analysis**:
  - Designed queries to uncover insights into user sign-ups and sales patterns.
  - Ability to manage user-specific datasets and generate actionable insights for potential business strategies.

## Why This Project Stands Out

This project exemplifies hands-on data manipulation skills in SQL, demonstrating my ability to structure, analyze, and generate insights from real-world datasets. The structured approach and attention to data integrity highlight my readiness to contribute to data-driven teams and projects.
